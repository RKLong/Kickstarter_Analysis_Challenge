#Overview of Project
Although Louise has already finished her campaign, she wants to find out how her campaign fared in comparison to the other theatre  campaigns. To be able to do this, the analyses created below which are outcomes based on goals and outcomes based on launch dates were made

##Analysis and Challenges

**Theatre Outcomes based on Launch Date**
The table/chart shows us the different outcomes based on the months the theatre kickstarter campaigns were launched. For the canceled theatre campaigns, its line graph is not continuous as there is a break in october, where no kickstarter campaigns were canceled.

**Outcomes Based on Goals**
Except for the first(below $1000) and last amount ($5,000 or greater), the goals are broken down in $5000 increments and instead of graphing the number of individual outcomes we used the the percentages for each of the outcomes. The graph only shows the percaentages of successful and failed campaigns, as there are no cancelled campaigns in the data provided.

**Challenges**
The challenge for me was in creating the table and chart for Theatre Outcomes by Launch Date. I would not say that it was lack of instruction, but it was more of me being in a hurry to get it done. It was a good thing the hints were posted and i was able to compare my work, backtrack and see where i might have made a mistake. In terms of making the graph/chart for it, the part I had to figure out was putting the % sign on the values on the y-axis, but I was able to figure it out once i changed the format of the dta on the column.
As for the Theatre Outcomes bansed on Launch Date chart/graph, the only challenge i had was changing or customizing the lines on the graph. Initially, i wanted them to match the colors assigned on the Kickstarter table, but I figured it would be safer to have the same format as the one shown on the module.

**Results**
*Theater Outcomes by Launch Date*
Based on the data provided, the months of May, June and July are months with the most successful campaigns launched, with May having the highest number of successful campaigns. 
The campaigns launched in December, January and October had the least number of successful campaigns.

*Outcomes Based on Goals*
More than 70% of Kickstarter Campaigns with goals that are at $5,000 and below were much more successful at reaching their goal; However based on the data for the goals between $20,000 to less than $45,000, there might be more factors in play for the success or failure of reaching the goal, specifically  in this range of amount, than just the amount of the goal itslef. The campaigns with goals 45,000 or greater had more difficulty reaching theeir goal. 

*Limitations and Recommendations for adiitional tables or graphs*
Since we knew what Louise's goal was, I think it would be interesting not just to take a look at the launch dates but to take a look at the the duration of the successful campaigns and to find out the relationship between the launch dates and the goals while only focusing on Louiseâ€™s goal or target of $12,000 (10000-14999).
